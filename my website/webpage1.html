                            batsman. He deviates
                            from conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. Dhoni displays a
                            proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket
                            regions, rather than the conventional Cover region MS Dhoni sheds his gloves and takes a wicket
